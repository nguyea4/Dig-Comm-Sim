Timeline: 
Soft deadline begining of final exma week
Hard deadling beginning of final exam week


MiniProject: Incorporate all these details together end-end
with these project
- Simulation via computer. MATLAB

Audio file -> [Tx system]--> Source Coding(Lempel Ziv) -->   Channel Coding(Convolutional Code) -> Modulation (QAM) --> CHANNEL CHARACTERISTICS (y =sqrt(p) x + N.  AWGN in simple case with x having unitary power)  -->[Demodulation] --> Channel decoding --> Source Coding -> [Rx system] --> Reconstructed File]

Comparing audio and audio_hat for a wide range of SNR. Done for both with and without channel coding
1) Can compare normalized mean square error ||(x-x_hat)/x||^2 as the final thing
2 Qualitative assessment
3 BER of the whole system
4) Compression RAtio of Source Coding, Fille size after / file size before. Since it is lossless 
5) Audio save as a file
